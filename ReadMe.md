<h1>Mass Mailer</h1><br>
Do you own a small business and you want an efficient, automatic and fast way to email your user about a new change about your business? Or maybe advertise something new?
Or do you want to run a small email based ad-campaign for free but you just have a couple hundered emails and no money?
Well this script has got your back :D
<br>
<h1>Features:</h1><br>
1. Email people just using a text file. It's fully automated so all you need is to wait for it to finish while you can lay back and relax.<br><br>
2. It's efficient and does not reveal the email of one user to the other. It's all direct.<br><br>
3. It's free! The only limitations you have are those provided by your mail provider.<br><br>

<h1>Requirements:</h1><br>
1. An email account/SMTP server and an account on it.<br>
2. Python 3.5+ (Preferably 3.8). You can install that from www.python.org<br>
3. A list of emails in a text file. See emails.txt in the repository to know how your text document should look like.<br>

<h1>How to use (Instructions for Gmail):</h1><br>
<br>
<b>Note: The only difference between the intructions of gmail and other smtp servers would just be that you won't need to turn on 2 Factor Authentication and set up an app password in others probably.</b><br><br>
1. Go to https://myaccount.google.com/security and turn 2 Factor Authentication on (It's google's safety policy.)<br><br>
2. After turning 2 Factor Authentication on, Go to https://myaccount.google.com/apppasswords click on "Select app", Select "Other (Custom Name)" and click "Generate"<br><br>
3. You will be given your password which you will later use while accessing this script. You can always make a new one and making a new one everytime is recommended to keep things secure.<br><br><b>Alternatively, you can use your own password by turning Access to less secure apps on but I don't recommend that for security reasons.</b><br><br><br>
4. Git clone the script:




```
git clone https://github.com/0x0elliot/massmailer
```



<br>
5. Go into the downloaded script's directory:




```
cd massmailer
```



<br>
6. Run the script using Python:




```
python3 massmailer.py
```




<br>
7. Fill in the details asked and you are good.<br>
